# Greedy-Ke
Greedy Ke is my first project when I learnt how to program. It is based on JavaFX. It aims to help me understand Java and how to program better.

## Introduction
Because I was a fresh man when I wrote this program, there must be lots of mistakes or smelled codes. This was just the first attempt to complete a project that I really want to do by myself. It havent be totally completed yet.

## Requirments
- Java **(Version 7+)**
- JavaFX **(Frankly, I am not sure how to build this. I built the environments on Eclipse, but it didn't work on terminal.)**
